# Keyrune v4

Keyrune is a complete SVG-based icon library and toolkit for Magic: the Gathering set symbols. Use them on your website just like any icon font, or print them outfor great looking card dividers and storage labels.

Version 4 represents hundreds of hours of labor-of-love, with re-drawn, normalized glyphs for accurate sizing and multi-layer support for every set symbol! Style the rarity, border, and inner layers separately and perfectly, all with cross-browser plug'n'play CSS classes.
