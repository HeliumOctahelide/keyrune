{"name":"Keyrune","tagline":"Magic: the Gathering set symbol pictographic font","body":"# Keyrune v0.1\r\n\r\n## The Magic: the Gathering set symbol font!\r\n\r\nKeyrune is the first suite of complete Magic: the Gathering expansion and set symbols as a pictographic font. You can use this font anywhere you want to display set symbols&mdash;in your MtG app or website, documents, card images, anything!\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nEach set symbol has its own font character. Display them in a manner similar to [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) using the `<i class=\"ss ss-exp\"></i>` element. Class name codes are based on the expansion codes from [MTG JSON](http://mtgjson.com).\r\n\r\nTo use Keyrune, move the font files to your `/fonts` directory and include the keyrune.css stylesheet in your `<head>`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link href=\"css/keyrune.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Editing the Source\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit the source files and compile Keyrune to fit your needs. Currently LESS is supported, with Sass coming soon.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nAll set symbol images are copyright Wizards of the Coast ([http://magicthegathering.com](http://magicthegathering.com))\r\n\r\nThe Keyrune font is licensed under the the SIL OFL 1.1 ([http://scripts.sil.org/OFL](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL))\r\n\r\nKeyrune CSS, LESS, and Sass files are licensed under the MIT License ([http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html))\r\n\r\nAttribution is **greatly appreciated** but not required!\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* v0.1 - initial font creation and CSS/LESS files for all sets up to Fate Reforged\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
